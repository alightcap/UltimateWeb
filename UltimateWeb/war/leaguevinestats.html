      <h1>Publishing game stats to leaguevine.com</h1>
      <br>If you would like to publish detailed stats from iUltimate to leaguevine.com please follow these steps to ensure the stats are published correctly.<br> 
	  <br/>
	  We strongly recommend that you become familiar with iUltimate and leaguevine.com BEFORE you take stats for your first game.  
	  Feel free to use <a href="https://www.leaguevine.com/seasons/20117/fake-league-2011/">Fake League</a> on leaguevine as test data to get comfortable.  
	  You can create new games and post stats to them while becoming familiar.
	  <br/><br/>
	  <p>If you still have a question (or suggestion) <a href="mailto:support@ultimate-numbers.com">send us a note</a>.</p>
	  <br/>
              <div >
              	<strong>I. Register at leaguevine.com</strong><br>
                <div>
                  Posting stats to leaguevine.com requires you to register with leaguevine.  IF you have not already done so,  
                  <a href="https://www.leaguevine.com/accounts/register/">register with leaguevine</a>.
                </div>

                <div>
                  For stats posting to leaguevine the team (and all players) must be created on leaguevine first.  Likewise for games.

                  <li>If you are publishing to leaguvine you should see a blue message on the game's action view.  
						<br/><img alt="" src="screenshots/actionviewleaguevinepub.jpg">
						<br/><br/>
				  </li>	
				  <li>To verify that you are sending stats to leaguvine, visit the leaguevine "play by play" page for your game.  
                        <ul>
                        	<li>Tap <strong>Vs.</strong> on the game view.</li>
                  			<li>Tap <strong>Leaguevine Website</strong> button.  This will open your leaguevine game in Safari.  Tap the "play-by-play" tab to see stats.  Make sure there are stats for YOUR team here.

                  		</ul>
                  		<br/><br/>
				  </li>	
				  <li>After choosing your game in iUltimate you don't need to have WIFI or 3/4G access to collect stats (although it is obviously better for the fans to see real-time updates).  When you are back online, start iUltimate.  Any stats posted
				  while you were offline will now be sent to leaguevine automatically.  You do not need to access the game or upload the game to iUltimate.  The posting will happen as soon as you 
				  start iUltimate if the iPhone/iPad is connected to the internet.

              	<strong>Tips</strong><br>
                <div>
                  <ul>
					  <li>Before each game: Make sure you refresh the players list (Team tab, players, Refresh button) if anybody has edited the roster on leaguvine.com.</li>	
   					  <li>To test publishing before the game starts, record the first pull or pass and verify it shows up in leaguevine.  Then press the UNDO to remove this event (it will be removed from Leaguevine as well).</li>
   					  <li>After the game: If your iPhone/iPad was...
						  <ul>
						  	<li>...<strong>connected</strong> to the Internet while gathering stats then your stats were immediately posted to the leaguevine site during the game (after every event).  Take a peek and verify that leaguevine is updated.</li>  
						  	<li>...<strong>NOT connected</strong> to the Internet while gathering stats then make sure you start iUltimate when you get an internet connection.  
						  	iUltimate will begin posting stats to leaguevine as soon as you connect to the internet and start the app.   You do not need to access the game or upload the game to iUltimate. 
						  	Note that posting a full game can take awhile so you might have to restart iUltimate several times to allow it to finish (consider turning off auto-lock to give the app time to post all of the events).
						  	</li>
