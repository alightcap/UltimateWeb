If the team is password protected you must authenticate before using the rest of the endpoints.

To authenticate:

http://www.ultianalytics.com/rest/view/team/{teamid}/authenticate/{password}
POST

Example: 
http://www.ultianalytics.com/rest/view/team/5153567363039232/authenticate/mypass

The response will include the response header IUltimateAuth which contains an authentication token you can use for subsequent calls.

On subsequent calls include the request heaeder iUltimateAuth with the value returned in the response header.
