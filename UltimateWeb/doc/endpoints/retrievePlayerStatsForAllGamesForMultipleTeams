POST
request body:  json array of team IDs, example: ["123234234234234", "45623423432434"]

Example response attached.   For each team there are 3 properties:
{
	"teamId":"5471866718257152", 
	"private":false,
	"playerStatsJson":"[{\"playerName\":\"Casey D\",\......"
}

If private is true there will be no playerStatsJson.
The playerStatsJson is embedded JSON.  This allows you to deserialize each team's stats individually if you prefer (to avoid a large object in memory).

see retreivePlayerStatsForGames for example JSON for the player stats.
